# Lotus

## History
### v1.0.0
- **_Lotus.Foundation.Assets_**

An asset handler that can resolve files, while tapping into Sitecore and offering behaviour desired for extensibility. Define paths in the configuration and let the handler do the rest.

- **_Lotus.Foundation.Extensions_**

Various extensions used throughout Lotus, while also offering shared functionality outside of the components.

- **_Lotus.Foundation.Logging_**

The start of an extended logging system, tapping into the rich functionality offered from log4net, while using the XML factory provided by Sitecore for configuration management.

- **_Lotus.Foundation.Caching_**

The start of a rich caching provider that will potentially change the game for cache building currently offered (simply put; cache generation outside of user interactivity - controlled by content editors on-demand).

- **_Lotus.Foundation.WebControls_**

Another element of the caching overhaul, focusing on the control-layer of this process.
